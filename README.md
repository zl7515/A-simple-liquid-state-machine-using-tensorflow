# A-simple-liquid-state-machine-using-tensorflow

We utilize tensorflow to create a simple liquid state machine (reservoir) composed of Izhikevich neurons. There are 20% inhibitory neurons and 80% excitatory neurons in the reservoir. The other model parameters are demonstrated in the notebook. The code is a modification of https://github.com/kaizouman/tensorsandbox/blob/master/snn/simple_spiking_model.ipynb
